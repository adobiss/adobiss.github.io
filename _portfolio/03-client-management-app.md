**GitHub:** [Client Management System](https://github.com/adobiss/db-api-frontend)

## Introduction

The objective was to develop a functional and easily demonstrable web application prototype in five days with zero budget (aside from operating and overhead costs). The project aimed to incorporate key skills such as project and database management, API integration, user interface (UI) and business intelligence (BI). The web application had to perform CRUD operations on a database for authenticated users via UI and API integration with optional BI dashboards. The above was formalised in a form of a project scope, constraints and both functional and non-functional requirements.

## Scoping

The initial scoping involved choosing PostgreSQL over MySQL for its advanced features like scalability and complex operations, as both are relatively simple to set up. FastAPI was selected as the server-side framework due to previous experience and straightforward documentation capabilities.

## Design Decisions

### Database

Challenges arose with local database setup not being easily reproducible, leading to a decision to use cloud-based services. Supabase was chosen amongst Neon and Tembo for its ease of prototyping and automatic API generation.

The database schema included three linked tables (digital dailies, projects and clients) and was designed to include essential features like restrictive foreign key relationships and mandatory fields, ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss.

### API Integration

A significant scope adjustment was made when it was determined that a web server was unnecessary for CRUD operations. Supabase's JavaScript client library enabled direct UI connections, simplifying the architecture and allowing the front-end to be hosted on Netlify for free.

JavaScript code structure was designed to facilitate future middleware implementation in FastAPI for additional validation, error handling and any other business logic by simply changing the endpoint URLs in fetch requests.

### BI Considerations

Metabase was considered for its integration with Supabase, however required hosting. Google Studio, Power BI and Tableau Public were shortlisted for further consideration to maintain the serverless prototype architecture.

### UI

Upon closer user journey review UI was simplified to only include a single table that didn’t have any foreign key relationships. This was done to avoid complexities with linking related records during ‘create’ operations.

Additionally, ‘update’ and ‘delete’ operations were excluded from the prototype to protect the integrity of the existing demo records.

### Security

User authentication required for both ‘create’ and ‘retrieve’ operations via Row Level Security policies.

## Front-end Development

Step-by-step development instructions and additional codebase generated by ChatGPT based on detailed system specifications.

## Result

The web application prototype was successfully deployed on Netlify. It connected to the database hosted on Supabase and allowed authenticated users to view, search and add records to the ‘clients’ table.

Authentication issues and navigation challenges were addressed through iterative debugging with the help of ChatGPT and manual deployment.

The prototype included a basic, clean UI with a focus on simplicity and functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Finalising Basic Functionality

- Add BI dashboard(s).
- Connect all three tables (digital dailies, projects and clients), implement ‘update’ and ‘delete’ operations for certain tables/ users.
- Optimise design for mobile.

## Future Enhancements

- Fast API server layer: utilising Supabase client but structured in a way that facilitates switching to Object Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries such as SQLAlchemy for database agnostic development.
- Client-side input validation to help prevent a wide range of attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Comprehensive client-side logging.
