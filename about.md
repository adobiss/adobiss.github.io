My name is Archie Dobiss. I'm a Data Scientist with a strong background in data wrangling, bringing over seven years of experience in managing and processing large-scale music royalty datasets, comprising tens to hundreds of millions of rows. 

Skilled in Python and SQL, I utilise Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn for comprehensive data manipulation and exploration to prepare training data for AI and machine learning applications.

The 16-week intensive AI Bootcamp at the University of Huddersfield helped me expand my foundational knowledge in AI and machine learning.

With a proven track record of innovatively solving business problems using data, I'm keen to leverage these skills in roles focused on data preparation for AI/ ML applications.
