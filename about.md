My name is Archie Dobiss. I'm an entry-level Data Scientist and a seasoned Data Wrangler with over 5 years of experience ingesting and mapping music royalty datasets comprising tens to hundreds of millions of rows.

I'm proficient in Python and SQL, passionate about AI/ML, and enjoy using algorithms to scale and automate business processes.

After successfully completing a 16-week AI Bootcamp at the University of Huddersfield, I'm eager to apply my extensive data wrangling and data mapping background to gain further experience in the field of machine learning.

Dedicated to lifelong learning, I'm currently studying calculus and practicing relative pitch.

I enjoy using my technical and problem-solving skills to tackle complex problems, contributing to organisational growth.

My goal is to build a career as a Machine Learning-focused Data Scientist.
